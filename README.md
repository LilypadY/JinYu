# JinYu
## Overview
This app is a tiny electronic dictionary for dialect study.It introduces JinYu（晋语）,one of the most widely spoken dialects in China.This app is also considered as one of the fruits of the summer social practice of the Team Jinshanjinmei of Beihang University in 2017（北京航空航天大学晋善晋美暑期实践队）.
JinYu ,also knowned as Jin dialect,is one kind of dialect ,which is also the only Chinese language that has been officially recognized as the "independent language" in the han area of northern China.Considering the fact that more and more people has been aware of the significance of dialects in local culture while less and less people can speak their dialects well,we are doing a lot expecting to make a contribution to dialect protection.
